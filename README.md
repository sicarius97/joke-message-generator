# joke-message-generator

This program's purpose is to use the native Javascript fetch method to fetch a random dad joke from a random dad joke api and display it using a simple html file. This could be run locally in a variety of ways, I ran it using the liveserver extension that is available with VScode. This could also be run in a live server environment or the function could be used with other programs to display the jokes in a variety of ways.
